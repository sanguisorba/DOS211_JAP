# DOS211_JAP
 MS-DOS 2.11 Japanese (sanguisorba private version)

# NOTES

* There is no Japanese version of DEBUG.
* STDIO (IO-STRIN-IO2) is reconstructed code based on disassembly.

* IO.ASM and IO2.ASM were reconstructed by John Elliott, from MSDOS on Apricot PC.
* STRIN.ASM was reconstructed by me, from MSDOS on NEC PC-9800 / NEC N5200 / EPSON PC286.

(I've confirmed that STDIO is the same for these 3 models.)
